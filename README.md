# RETCONNECT

A human-readable ontology for expressing interconnected systems and platforms.

## Motivation

Our world is now full of connected devices that help us run our daily lives.  Behind the scenes, these devices interact with many cloud services and systems, in complex ways that are not made evident to end-users. Yet, it can be important to know how the important devices in our worlds are connected, and the services upon which they rely, for many reasons.  

For instance, at a basic level, you might want to know whether a system you need to rely on uses a particular intermediary.  This might be, for iexample, if an intermediary is known for unscrupulous business practices or has been hacked/compromised, you might want to avoid use of systems that use that.  Similarly, if a vital service that your system relies on lies in a hostile government or entity's jurisdiction, you might need to know this in order to assess what would happen if the hostile entity takes advantage of its position within your system.

More importantly, you might want to know all the services or entities that the systems you use use as data processors and/or controllers

## A human-machine language for describing systems and their services

This vocabulary makes it possible for information about systems to be easily declared, read, modified, and shared by people and by machines.
